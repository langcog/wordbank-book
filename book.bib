	Abstract = {The Spanish-language MacArthur--Bates Communicative Development Inventories (S-CDIs) are wellestablished parent report tools for assessing the language development of Spanish-speaking children under 3 years. Here, we introduce the short-form versions of the S-CDIs (SFI and SFII), offered as alternatives to the long forms for screening purposes or in applications requiring a less-demanding instrument. Norming data (SFI: n = 601; SFII: n = 2,534) from diverse populations in Mexico are described. Developmental trends, gender differences, and socioeconomic status effects are reported that parallel those for the long forms. An additional small-scale study (n = 62) demonstrates strong convergence between responses on the long and the short forms. These results provide evidence that the S-CDI SFs have promise for a range of clinical and research applications.},

@article{core2013,
	Abstract = {Purpose: Vocabulary assessment holds promise as a way to identify young bilingual children at risk for language delay. This study compares 2 measures of vocabulary in a group of young Spanish--English bilingual children to a single-language measure used with monolingual children. Method: Total vocabulary and conceptual vocabulary were used to measure mean vocabulary size and growth in 47 Spanish--English bilingually developing children from 22 to 30 months of age based on results from the MacArthur--Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI; Fenson et al., 1993) and the Inventario del Desarrollo de Habilidades Comunicativas (Jackson-Maldonado et al., 2003). Bilingual children's scores of total vocabulary and conceptual vocabulary were compared with CDI scores for a control group of 56 monolingual children. Results: The total vocabulary measure resulted in mean vocabulary scores and average rate of growth similar to monolingual growth, whereas conceptual vocabulary scores were significantly smaller and grew at a slower rate than total vocabulary scores. Total vocabulary identified the same proportion of bilingual children below the 25th percentile on monolingual norms as the CDI did for monolingual children. Conclusion: These results support the use of total vocabulary as a means of assessing early language development in young bilingual Spanish--English speaking children.},
